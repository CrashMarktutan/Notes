1(a)(ii)A one 1/1

1(a)(iii)C three 1/1

1(b)Cellulose is formed by the joining of two beta glucose molecules these joinings form a long chain of polymers then these chains are cross linked by hydrogen bonds on top of each other to form microfibrils as shown in the photograph these chain are super imposed on top of each other to increase the strength of the cell wall. In the primary cell wall they are oriented in the same direction in parallel but in secondary cell wall they are oriented in a criss cross arrangement giving more strength to the cell wall.

2/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

There are hydrogen bonds in adjacent cellulose molecules from the long cellulose chains forming layers of microfibrils in secondary cell wall these layers of microfibrils are arranged in different angles increasing the strength of the cell wall

3(b)(i)0-6.25 hours the DNA content remains same as the cell is in the G1 phase and is preparing for DNA replication then from 6.25 hours to 10 hours replication takes place and the cell passes the S and G2 phases as well then the cell from 10-15 hours mitosis takes place and then from 15 hours to 15.25 hours cytokinesis takes place and then after that the cell replicates into cell with the same amount of DNA content as the cell before the cell cycle took place

1/4

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

DNA content remains same throughout G1, G2 and mitosis then the DNA content doubles due to S phase of replication then the cell divides and cytokinesis takes place after 15 hours therefore it produces two diploid daughter cells

4(a)43/100*(14/100*48)=2.89mg 2/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

2.9mg to 2s.f

(b)Cutlery made from wheat bran is biodegradable but cutlery made from oil-based plastics will be non-biodegradable and it is made from a renewable resource as wheat can be grown again but crude oil from which oil-based plastics cannot be made again. Wheat bran has less greenhouse emissions whereas crude oil has very high greenhouse emissions

3/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

cutlery made from wheat bran is more sustainable and is biodegradable and is carbon neutral

4(c)The pollen tube begins to grow out if the pollen grain is recognised and it continues to grow down towards the ovary and on the way down undergoes mitosis to form 2 generative nuclei once the tube enters the microphyle the male nuclei pass into the ovule and one male nucleus fuses with two polar bodies nuclei to form the endosperm nucleus, which is triploid

3/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

pollen tube transports generative nucleus to micropyle by releasing digestive enzymes one of the male nuclei fertilizes the two polar nuclei to form triploid endosperm nucleus

5(a)(i)A group of similar cells performing a specific function 1/1

5(a)(ii)Mitotic indexes of P=4/16*100%=25%, Q=6/14*100%=43% and R=9/11*100%=82%. Patient P is in the first stage of cancer as the mitotic index is 25%, Patient Q is in the second stage of cancer as the mitotic index is 43% and has increased by 18%, Patient R has mitotic index 82% and this can be reached after we have increased the mitotic index by 18% twice from 43% therefore Patient R is the fourth stage of cancer.

0/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Patient P has a mitotic index = 4/20*100%=20% and Patient R has a mitotic index = 9/20*100%=45% therefore Patient P has a earlier stage of cancer

5(b)In stage 1 the probability of survival decreases at a steady rate. In stage 2 the probability of survival of survival decreases at a faster rate than stage 1 then decreases at a steady rate. In stage 4 the probability of survival decreases at the fastest rate then decreases at a steady rate and in the probability remains same in the end.

2/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Survival probability decreases over time for all stages. Stage 1 has the slowest survival probability decrease. Stage 4 has the highest survival probability decrease.

5(c)In a double-blind trial half of the people are given the actual drug and half are given the placebo and the docters and nurses adminsering the doses don't know whether a given drug contains a placebo or the actual drug.

1/2

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Placebo is a drug which has no active ingredient and in a double-blind trial one group is given the actual trial drug and the other group is given the placebo, neither the patient nor the doctor knows who has got the actual drug or the placebo.

6(a)Planning: oxygen, water, optimum temperature, optimum pH, glucose source

Answer: The bacteria should be given adequate oxygen concentration and glucose concentration and water as that will make aerobic respiration to take place and give enough energy for syntesis of new proteins leading to growth and optimum temperature and optimum pH should be given for enzyme calalysed reactions to produce proteins

6(b)(ii)Planning: Answer: mean ulcer decreases by 707mm^2 with omeprazole, this is due to the omeprazole being trialed and the dosage being changed to the best possible effectiveness, but mean ulcer   decreases by approximately 600mm^2, as this as only one extract and no other ingredients but omeprazole has many active ingredients when treated with more extract 30 mm^2 of more ulcer is decreased by increasing the extract even more only a small amount of mean ulcer is decreased as effectiveness of the extract only increases a little after more dosage

2/6

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Mean ulcer area decreases by 707 mm^2 with omeprazole, mean mass of mucus decreases a little with omeprazole from the value in control rats with no ulcer, mean ulcer area decreases by approximately 600mm^2 with extract but mean mass of  mucus decreases more than with omeprazole and when treated with more extract the mean area of ulcer decreases by 30mm^2 more and mean mass of mucus also decreases even more. Omeprazole was the most effective treatment. As mean mass of mucus increases, mean area of ulcer decreases. Ulcer is caused by bacteria damaging stomach lining omeprazole and extract increase mucus production this causes the ulcer area to decrease. High mucus content prevents acid contents damaging stomach lining.[]. 	omeprazole and extract causes the stomach lining to increase. Omeprazole and extract reduces acidity of stomach making it less suitable for H, pylori. Antimicrobial properties omeprazole reduces number and reproduction of bacteria therefere reduced population growth leads to decreased damage of the stomach lining

7(a)(i)A metaphase I 1/1

7(a)(ii)A metaphase I 0/1 

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme: C prophase I

7(b)Crossing over happens in prophase I which causes parts of the homologous chromosomes to break up and join in the other chromosome which causes the combination of alleles to change so when meiosis takes place the percentage of combination of alleles in the haploid daughter cells changes causing the percentage of combination of alleles to change in the gametes produced.

0/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Due to linkage A and B are on the same chromosome therefore AB and ab which are 48% in the total gametes produced are not seperated due to crossing over and are inherited together as the two loci are closer together there is less chance of seperation. Ab aB which are 2% in total gametes produced are formed by crossing over

7(c)Planning: Answer: From the dna strand a pre-mRNA is formed, exons which is coding DNA and introns which is non coding DNA these are joined together to form and introns are removed and enzyme complexes called spliceosomes which join exons or remove exons in some cases and then these form different mRNAs for the same gene in this way this lead to the formation of different amino acid chains which lead to the formation of differnt polypeptides and then different proteins

4/5

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

From the DNA strand a pre-mRNA is formed in which post transcriptional changes take place in which this pre-mRNA is made by joining introns and exons which is the non-coding and coding DNA then to form the mRNA introns are removed and exons are joined in different orders to form different mRNA strands and there is removal of some exons as well in forming mRNA which could form two different permutations which could be SUW and WQUS therefore in this way different sequence of amino acids would be formed and then due to these different polypeptide chains would be formed which would in different shapes to form different proteins

7(d)In Gene T the activity of the gene increases till 4th cell then decreases as the stages of the development come forth. In Gene U the activity of the gene at the start in constant till 4th cell then increases

1/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Overall the activity of gene T decreases during development and activity of gene U increases as gene T is switched off gene T is not needed and protein is not produced once blastocyst stage is reached. Product of gene U is needed at higher levels after the morula stage.

8(b)They have the same anatomical features 1/1

8(c)Due to chicks being predated on the mice got more food so over time there body evolved to be able to eat more chicks

0/4

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Genetic mutation occurs resulting in new allele coding for larger size and ability to digest more meat which then conferred a selective advantage making it more likely for mutated mice to survive and reproduce therefore passing alleles to offspring and then increasing allele frequency. Mutated mice on this island become reproductively isolated resulting in two different species

*8(d)Tristan albatross should be conserved on the island as this place has the best environment based on this species so a predator for mice should be introduced into the community and therefore this would control the mice population in the region and maintain the population of the albatross on the islands. To further help them special regions should be created on the island where mice cannot reach the nests of the albatross so the population of albatross does not decrease. We could also increase the population of the fish, octopus and squid in waters near the albatross population.

2/6

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Albatrosses can be conserved on the island by introducing laws to protect the albatrosses and removal of predators can be done through trapping mice or poisoning them or introducing a predator of mice so more chicks will survive to breeding age. There should be a fishing exclusion zone for the places where albatrosses hunt for fish, octupus and squid therefore supplying more food to albatross and also there is more food available for parents to give to chicks therefore increases the population size. There should be reintroduction program and there should be strategies to ensure increased survival chances of reintroduced birds e.g removal of mice, behavioural conditioning. Albatrosses can also be conserved in zoos by taking breeding pairs to zoos and keeping them in captive breeding programmes and reference to studbooks be given to better help the conservation of the species. Collecting of eggs can be done and making them hatch somewhere else therefore the offspring are not eaten by mice and are protected from predators and the offspring should be reintroduced to the island to increase population size and reintroduce the albatross currently held in zoos therefore this would also increase there population size. Captive breeding can be used to maintain genetic diversity. And Hardy Weinberg equation can be used to see change in allele frequency over time.
