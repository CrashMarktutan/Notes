1(a)(ii)A one 1/1

1(a)(iii)C three 1/1

1(b)Cellulose is formed by the joining of two beta glucose molecules these joinings form a long chain of polymers then these chains are cross linked by hydrogen bonds on top of each other to form microfibrils as shown in the photograph these chain are super imposed on top of each other to increase the strength of the cell wall. In the primary cell wall they are oriented in the same direction in parallel but in secondary cell wall they are oriented in a criss cross arrangement giving more strength to the cell wall.

2/3

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

There are hydrogen bonds in adjacent cellulose molecules from the long cellulose chains forming layers of microfibrils in secondary cell wall these layers of microfibrils are arranged in different angles increasing the strength of the cell wall

2(b)(i)Magnification=Image Size/Actual Size Sir didn't print this but saw in MS to understand how much I have unzoom in the pdf viewer to measure it with scale on my screen but the formula I knew other qs I will be able to measure from screen

2(b)(ii)To carry out photosynthesis 1/1

2(b)(iii)It contains a membrane bound nucleus 1/1

2(c)(i)Plasmodesmata 1/1

2(c)(ii)They are connected to the ER(Endoplasmic Reticulum) and are involved in the passage of substances from one plant cell to another.

0/2

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

Helps in communication between connected cells therefore causes signaling substances to pass through cytoplasm

3(b)(i)0-6.25 hours the DNA content remains same as the cell is in the G1 phase and is preparing for DNA replication then from 6.25 hours to 10 hours replication takes place and the cell passes the S and G2 phases as well then the cell from 10-15 hours mitosis takes place and then from 15 hours to 15.25 hours cytokinesis takes place and then after that the cell replicates into cell with the same amount of DNA content as the cell before the cell cycle took place

3/4

Corrected answer after looking at the mark scheme:

DNA content remains same throughout G1, G2 and mitosis then the DNA content doubles due to S phase of replication then the cell divides and cytokinesis takes place after 15 hours therefore it produces two diploid daughter cells
