Wave motion
Doppler effect Δλ = λv/c Δf = fv/c

Travelling wave y = a sin[ωt – kx] = a sin2π[t/T – x/λ]

Standing wave y = 2a cos[2πx/λ]sin[2πt/T]

Velocity of sound (v) = √[γP/ρ]

Frequency of stretched string fo = (1/2L)√[T/m]1/2

Fundamental frequency (closed tube) fo = v/4L

Intensity of wave I = ka2

Beat frequency f = f1 – f2

Organ pipes:
Open pipe f = (m + 1)fo

Closed at one end f = (2m + 1)fo

Thermal Physics
