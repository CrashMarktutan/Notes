Physics is divided into two main parts:a
1. Classical Physics
2. Modern Physics

1. Classical Physics

Physics up to 1900 AD is considered as Classical physics. Its main subdivisions are as follows:

A. Mechanics: It is that branch of physics that deals with the study of motion. No doubt motion is the fundamental idea in all of science. It is also related to the properties of matter and light.

B. Optics: All incidents related to light and its production, transmission and detection are studied.

C. Sound and Wave Motion: Under it the wave speed and sound production and transmission are studied.

D. Heat and Thermodynamics: This branch deals with the process of heat, its transmission and changes in its function.

E. Electromagnetism: It deals with electromagnetic radiation. Or we can say that it is the phenomenon of the interaction of electric currents or fields and magnetic fields.

2. Modern Physics

Is the twentieth century physics. Its main subdivisions are as follows:

A. Atomic Physics: In this, the interaction of atom and its radiations are studied.

B. Nuclear Physics: Deals with the structure of the nucleus and the interactions of the nuclear particles.

C. Quantum Physics: This is a special type of mechanism in which the behaviour of molecules, atoms, and nuclear particles is described.

D. Theory of Relativity: In 1905, Einstein propounded a specific principle of relativity, in which the interaction of very high speed particles are explained. Later, in 1915, Einstein presented a general theory of relativity in which the definition of gravitation was also explained.

E. Cosmology and Space Exploration: In this branch the study of the origin, structure and the movement of various celestial bodies of the world is studied. In the space exploration, the launch and the study of man-made or artificial satellites and the information received from them is also analyzed and studied.

F. Mesoscopic physics deals with materials of an intermediate length in a sub discipline condensed matter. The scale of these materials can be described as being between the nano scale size of a quantity of atoms (such as a molecule) and of materials measuring micrometres.
