Elasticity


Stress   stress = F/A

Strain strain = e/L

Young modulus   E = F/LeA

Bulk modulus   K = Dp/(Dv/v)

Rigidity or shear modulus (G) G = [F/A]/θ

Potential energy stored = ½ Fe = ½ EAe2/L

Energy per unit volume = ½ stress x strain

Thermal expansion


F = EAαθ

Friction


Coefficient of friction (μ) F = μR

Viscosity


Coefficient of viscosity (η) F = hA x velocity gradient

Stokes' law F = 6πhrv

Poiseuille's formula Volume s-1 = πhρgr4/8ηl

Surface tension


Capillary rise (h) T cosθ = hrρg/2

Excess pressure in air bubble p = 2T/r

Excess pressure in soap bubble p = 4T/r

Geometrical Optics


Refractive index (n) = sin i/sin r = real depth/apparent depth

Related to wave velocities (n) = cm/cv

Serial relation n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2

Thin prism   d = (n – 1)A

Critical angle(c) n = 1/sin c

Lens formulae 1/u + 1/v = 1/f

Telescope magnification (m) = fo/fe

Angular magnification   M = - (D/f+ 1)

Resolving power f = 1.22λ/a

Physical Optics


Constructive interference path difference for a maximum = mλ

Destructive interference path difference for a minimum= (2m + 1)λ/2

Young's slits   ml = xmd/D

Newton's rings (dark ring viewed by reflection) mλ = rm2/R

Thin film interference mλ = 2nt cos r

Diffraction grating (max)    mλ = e sinθ

Brewster's law (polarisation) tan p = n

Malus' law I = Iocos2θ
