Statics
Weight (F) = mg

Pressure (P) = F/A

Pressure at a depth h in a liquid in a liquid (P) = hρg

Density (ρ) = m/V

Couple (C) = Fd

Upthrust (U) = vρg

Projectiles
Range (R) = u2sin2A/g

Maximum height (h) = u2sin2A/2g

Time of flight t = 2usinA/g

Motion in a circle
Angular velocity ω = θ/t

Linear and angular velocity v = rω

Time of rotation period T = 2πr/v = 2π/ω

Centripetal force F = mv2/r = mω2r
