Formulae list

Some of these formulae should be memorised during your higher level course but the list covers a great deal more than is needed for a simple extension to the foundation course. It is most important that you are sure of the meaning of all the symbols

Equations of motion
s = vt

v = u + at

v2 = u2 + 2as

s = ut + ½ at2

average vel. = [u + v]/2

Dynamics
Momentum M = mv

Impulse I = Ft

Newton's second law F = d(mv)/dt = ma

Impulse and momentum Ft = mv – mu

Kinetic energy k.e = ½ mv2

Potential energy p.e = mgh

Work work = Fs

Power Power = Fv
