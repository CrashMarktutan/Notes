Electrostatics


Electric field strength E = - dV/dx

Force between point charges F = Q1Q2/[4πεd2]

Field due to point charge Q E = Q/[4εd2]

Potential V = W/Qo

Potential due to charge Q VE = Q/[4πεd]

Capacitance (C) = Q/V

Capacitance of a sphere (C) = 4πεr

Parallel-plate capacitor C = εA/d

Parallel capacitors      C = C1 + C2

Series capacitors      1/C = 1/C1 + 1/C2

Energy (E) stored by a capacitor = ½ CV2 = ½ QV = ½ Q2/C

Capacitor discharge      V = Voe-t/RC

Capacitor charge      V = Vo[1 - e-t/RC]


Electromagnetism


Couple on coil (C) = BANIsinθ

Field at centre of coil of N turns (B) = μoNI/2r

Field in solenoid (B) = μoNI/L

Field at end of long solenoid of N turns (B) = μoNI/2L

Helmholtz coils field (B) = 8μoNI/5[5]1/2r

Field near straight wire (B) = μoI/2πr

Velocity of e.m. waves c = 1/(εoμo)1/2


Electromagnetic induction


Self-inductance L = Nφ/I

Mutual inductance M = Nsφs/Ip

Induced e.m.f. (ε) = -L dI/dt

Induced e.m.f. (εs) = - MdI/dt

Induced e.m.f. in a rotating coil (ε) = BANωsinθ

Induced e.m.f.(Neumann's law) ε = - Ndφ/dt

Transformer      np/ns = Vp/Vs and Ip/Is = ns/np

Root mean square current (I) I = io/21/2

Alternating current i = io sin(ωt)

Capacitative reactance Xc = 1/ωC

Inductive reactance XL = ωL

Impedance (series RLC) Z = [R2 + (XL _ XC)2]1/2
