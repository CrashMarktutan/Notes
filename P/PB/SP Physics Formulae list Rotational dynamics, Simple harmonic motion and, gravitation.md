Rotational dynamics
Moment of inertia (I) = Σmr2

Angular momentum (M) = Iω

Rotational kinetic energy = ½ Iω2

Couple (C) = Iα

Work done W = Cθ

Simple harmonic motion
Acceleration a = -ω2 x

Displacement x = rsin(ωt)

Velocity v = ±ω√(r2 - x2)

Acceleration a = -ω2rsin(ωt)

Velocity v = ωr cos (ωt)

Kinetic energy = ½ mω2(r2 - x2)

Potential energy = ½ mω2x2

Total energy E = ½ mω2r2

Gravitation
Kepler's third law T2/r3 = constant

Newton's law F = Gm1m2/d2

Potential energy p.e = - GmM/r

Kinetic energy k.e = +GmM/2r

Total energy E = - GmM/2r

Potential VG = - GM/r

go and G go = GM/R2

g and go (r> R) g = goR2/r2

g and go (r < R) g = gor/R

Escape velocity v = √[2Rgo]
